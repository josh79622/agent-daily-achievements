# Progress

## Current phase

**Phase 4 — Report intelligence**

The project has moved past an experience-only prototype. A local collector demo can read Claude Code and Codex JSONL records for the executing computer's local calendar day only after the user saves an explicit source choice. It presents source/session metadata and exposes an on-demand local preview endpoint. Phase 3 has passed its exit review; Phase 4 will define the separately consented report-generation path.

## Completed

- Phase 1 foundation: `BRIEF.md`, canonical `AGENTS.md`, TypeScript skeleton, CI, and the `npm run check` gate.
- Phase 2 experience spike: the three-achievement constellation with expand/related interactions and narrow-screen layout.
- Phase 3 collector spike:
  - normalized Claude Code and Codex fixture parsing;
  - local-timezone date filtering, source/session identity, and malformed-line issue reporting;
  - metadata-first local API and browser panel;
  - local message preview fetched only after the user selects a session.
- Phase 3 first-read consent gate:
  - server-enforced source choice stored as ignored local JSON with no conversation contents;
  - absent, invalid, unreadable, or unsavable settings fail closed;
  - a collection keeps its saved scope until completion, then later choices apply to a later collection;
  - source selection and disclosure in the local page; completed results remain until a later collection succeeds.
- Phase 3 local timezone:
  - collection uses the executing computer's system timezone rather than a fixed Sydney timezone;
  - timezone boundary, non-Sydney, and invalid-timezone behavior are covered by synthetic unit tests.
- Unit-test framework:
  - all existing unit tests use Vitest, with one `npm test` command and no `node:test` or `node:assert` imports in the test suite.
- Phase 3 Claude Code parser verification:
  - verified common real local JSONL structure read-only with no content retained;
  - added synthetic Vitest coverage for timestamp validity, BOM/CRLF input, structured content, malformed input, source read-only behavior, and report-day session context;
  - verified that a real `fork-context-ref` metadata record is ignored while the same file's direct session remains available; future parent-only sidechain conversations are excluded to avoid duplicate counting.
- Phase 3 Codex parser verification:
  - verified recent active and archived JSONL structure read-only with no content retained;
  - added synthetic Vitest coverage for observed message and metadata shapes, timestamp and malformed input, report-day context, duplicates, and source read-only behavior;
  - duplicate IDs produce an incomplete result rather than duplicate sessions; stream reconciliation remains a separate task.
- Phase 3 source coverage states:
  - distinguishes a source that is not installed, has no report-day activity, or has incomplete data from an unreadable path, unsupported format, partial write, malformed record, or duplicate session;
  - preserves available data from one source while showing another selected source's incomplete state in the local page and collector API.
- Phase 3 session-file deduplication:
  - merges repeated or split files only within the same source and session ID;
  - preserves one exact duplicate message, merges distinct messages chronologically, and marks conflicting message IDs incomplete without guessing;
  - retains the report-day context rule after merging.
- Phase 3 exit review:
  - documented the evidence-backed local-source behavior, limitations, privacy
    boundary, and later work in [the exit review](docs/reviews/2026-09-17-phase-3-exit-review.md);
  - confirmed that Phase 3 does not claim a first-version release or support
    for the Chrome sources.

## Important boundaries

- The collector must not transmit records, persist conversation text, or commit private data.
- The current development demo reads Josh's local data only because he explicitly authorized this in the conversation. A product user must receive a local-source consent and scope choice before the first read.
- Consent to read local histories is separate from consent to transmit complete same-day conversations to a chosen Claude Code or Codex summarizer.

## Next task

Implement the Phase 4 installation-time external-summarization permission task. Josh confirmed these product-derived unit-test cases on 2026-09-17; first show the corresponding Vitest test code one-to-one, then run it RED before implementation:

1. No installation-time permission prevents creation or transmission of a summarization request.
2. Maximum-permission disclosure names the approved source scope, complete report-day conversations, and possible Codex/Claude Code recipients.
3. Codex is the default when both CLIs are usable; Claude Code is used when it alone is usable.
4. Saved maximum permission covers scheduled runs and CLI fallback without another consent prompt.
5. A failed or unavailable Codex automatically tries Claude Code; if both fail, the report is incomplete with the failure reason.
6. A later interface change to permission or the preferred CLI applies to later requests.

## Latest verification

- Phase 3 exit review: `npm run check` passed with format, lint, typecheck, 63 tests, and build. DD-1 through DD-6 use only temporary synthetic source files because the current local snapshot has no duplicate session ID. No E2E test was run; product-wide E2E testing is deferred until all planned functionality is complete.
- The shell's default Node 25 fails to start because of a missing Homebrew library; use `/opt/homebrew/opt/node@24/bin` on `PATH` for the approved Node 24 runtime (verified v24.20.0).

## Handoff

- Active worktree: `.worktrees/ui-skeleton`
- Branch: `codex/ui-skeleton`
- Local demo: `http://127.0.0.1:4317/`
- The server is running from the built worktree output. Restart it after server changes.
